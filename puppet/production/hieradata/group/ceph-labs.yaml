# TODO: it socks. In a perfect world, these data
# don't exist because already present in the "ceph"
# hash. But there are 2 problems:
#
#   1. It's difficult to extract data in "ceph" hash
#      to have "hosts" entries structure like below.
#
#   2. The '::profiles::hosts::standard' manage the unique
#      /etc/hosts files so I think it's impossible to
#      coexist '::profiles::hosts::standard' and
#      '::profiles::hosts::ceph' to cumulate "hosts"
#      entries in "network" hash and in "ceph" hash.
