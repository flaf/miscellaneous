# Plugins == "lib directories of all modules in the master".
# The synchronisation from master to node is necessary for
# codes that are executed in client side (like specific
# resources types defined in modules). This is not the
# case for custom functions, for instance, which are
# executed in master side (any change of custom functions
# required a restart of the master because the code is
# loaded by the master during the restart only).
#
# In fact, since Puppet 3.0.2, the default value is true.
# So, in Debian Wheezy, which use the version 2.7, you must
# specify explicitly this parameter, and in Debian Ubuntu
# Trusty (3.4.3), it isn't mandatory.

# These are needed when the puppetmaster is run by passenger
