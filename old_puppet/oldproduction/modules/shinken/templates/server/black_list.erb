# This file contains rules to cancel notification.
# Each line is a rule.
#
# For a service, the syntax is:
#
#   <contact regex>:<host regex>:<service description regex>:<timeslots>
#
# For a host, the syntax is (service description is empty):
#
#   <contact regex>:<host regex>::<timeslots>
#
# If a regex begins with ! (exclamation mark), the matching
# is reversed. By example, with this rule:
#
#   !^joe$:.*:^load cpu$:[00h00;11h00][17h00;23h59]
#
# there is no "load cpu" notification (for any host), except for "joe"
# from 5:00 PM to 11:00 AM.
